# •Sum•
__Con/IO__ is a lightwight terminal library, made to recreate [Console](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dotnet/api/system.console) API for [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and fix `std\terminal` issues.  
Full compatibility is not prioritized at given moment, but desirable in future.  
❗ Currently only compiles on Windows systems ❗

# •Featuræ•
* Standartized coloration support.
* Enforced prefix (`con.`) API isolation.
* Extended ASCII support for both input and output.
* Getters/setters to manage terminal title, buffer size and visibility.

# •Remark•
Since __Con/IO__ was developed mainly for internal usage, no documentation will likely be included before v0.3.  
Provided examples and reading original .NET docs is a way to understand how to use this lib until then.
